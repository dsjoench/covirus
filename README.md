# Covoronvirus Analysis 

## Background

2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is a virus (more specifically, a coronavirus) identified as the cause of an outbreak of respiratory illness first detected in Wuhan, China. Early on, many of the patients in the outbreak in Wuhan, China reportedly had some link to a large seafood and animal market, suggesting animal-to-person spread. However, a growing number of patients reportedly have not had exposure to animal markets, indicating person-to-person spread is occurring. At this time, itâ€™s unclear how easily or sustainably this virus is spreading between people - CDC

This is not a case tracker since more than sufficient well-done tracker are already available.

COVI19 indeed has been a big shock to American. A lot of people haven't experienced it before and they don't know how to react to this dramatic crisis happening to this country. 

The way a country combats virus depends on many factors. Different countries have different policy, resources, medical supplies, interest groups that influence the decision.

## This analysis aims to answer the following questions:
#### 1. Which countries flatten the curve faster than others? 

#### 2. What are they doing differently than other countries? Mask culture, # Hospitial, # of medical staff, #Ventilator, and day starting lockdown play a key?

#### 3. Is wearing mask without social distancing more effective than social distancing (Lockdown)?

Success= confirmed case/population , recovered/total case, death/total case? 

## Proposed metrics 

Success= confirmed case/population , recovered/total case, death/total case? 

# Data Collection
Population, mask culture, number of hospital, # medical staff, # Ventilator, # social distancing start date
